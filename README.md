##  About
`Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!`  

##  Learning outcomes
`After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.`

<ol>
	<li>Prints an empty field at the beginning of the game.</li>
	<li>Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a field with the changes if everything is ok.</li>
	<li>Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.</li>
</ol>
